# SQL Project - Hospital Admissions Analytics


## Project Overview

This project is a **SQL analytics portfolio** designed to demonstrate practical, job-ready SQL skills for a **Data Analyst** role.

Using a realistic hospital database schema, the project answers common **business and operational questions** that healthcare administrators, operations teams, and analysts face daily — such as patient flow, doctor workload, readmission risk, and regional demand patterns.

The focus is not only on writing correct SQL, but on:
- Translating **business questions into data logic**
- Writing **clear, readable, and efficient queries**
- Demonstrating **analytical thinking**, not just syntax

---

##  Dataset & Schema

The database schema represents a simplified hospital system with the following entities:

- **patients** – demographic and physical attributes
- **doctors** – physician information and specialty
- **admissions** – hospital admission records
- **province_names** – geographic lookup table

> ⚠️ **Important note**  
> The database schema used in this project is **copied from**:

>  
> This project is for **educational and portfolio purposes only**.  
> All SQL queries, analysis, and interpretations are **original work** created by me.

## Business Questions & KPIs

Each SQL query in this project is framed around a **real business problem**, not just a technical exercise.


---

| Business Themes | Key KPIs |
|---------------|---------|
| 🏥Hospital demand & trends | 📅Monthly admission volume |
| 👥Patient demographics & regions | ⏱️Average length of stay (LOS) |
| 🩺Doctor workload & specialty use | 🔁30-day readmission rate |
| 📊Quality & safety metrics | 👨‍⚕️Admissions per doctor |
| 🧹Data quality validation | 🗺️Top diagnoses by province |
| ⚠️Risk segmentation | 🔥High-utilization patients |


##  SQL Skills Demonstrated

This project intentionally showcases a wide range of **core SQL competencies**, including:

- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, multi-table joins
- Aggregations (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`)
- Date calculations and time-based analysis
- Window functions (`RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `LAG`)
- Conditional logic (`CASE WHEN`)
- Data quality checks and anomaly detection
- Cohort and segmentation analysis

Queries are written with **clarity and readability in mind**, reflecting how SQL is used in real analytics teams.
